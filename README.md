# uploadMultipleFilesApi --Henry

In this assignment I used nodeJs, Express and Multer to handle multiple file uploads to a partiuclar directory on the server.

*This repo contains an index.html(front-end) file that demonstrates an api request using fetch to post form data to the api
*Resoponse from the api can be found in the console logs

To use or test this repo code you would need to do the following:
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Navigate into the folder containing the code and run npm install
3. Then you can start the server by running "node ./index.js" in the terminal
4. Navigate and open index.html in your browser
5. Select multiple files after clicking on "Choose files" and then submit
6. Finally, check your "uploads" folder to find your uploaded files...
